# Code of Conduct

UWB Hacks the Cloud is going to be amazing! Let's lay some ground rules to make sure everyone has the best experience possible.

## TL;DR

The gist of the Code of Conduct is:

* be respectful to each other
* don't plagarize other people's work
* breaking these rules will have consequences

### Harassment

Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable environment and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of the following:

* gender
* gender identity and expression
* age
* sexual orientation
* disability
* physical appearance
* body size
* race
* ethnicity
* nationality
* religion
* political views
* previous hackathon attendance or lack of
* computing experience or lack of
* chosen programming language or tech stack

We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue; this includes the following:

* hacks
* talks, presentations, or demos
* workshops
* any parties associated to the hackathon
* social media
* any other online media

### Plagarism

Intentional direct plagiarism of code or visual content from other participants and readily available resources on the internet will not be tolerated.

If your project uses visual or programmatic elements that your team didn't create from scratch, you are expected to attribute credit to the original author(s).

Please use common sense, and take this opportunity to showcase your own individual creativity.

### Consequences

Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned at the discretion of the hackathon organisers. Any of the following consequences may result:

* being asked to leave the event
* being banned from future events hosted by the organizers
* having awards revoked

### Inquiries

If you have any questions about these rules, please contact [the hackathon organizers](https://uwbacm.com).
