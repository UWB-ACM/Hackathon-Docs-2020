# Submitting Your Project for Awards

## Preparing for the Hackathon & Submission

1. **Form a team.** Collaborating on a project with other people will result in a more rewarding experience overall, as well as a higher quality project.
2. **[Register](https://uwbhacks.devpost.com/register) for the hackathon on DevPost.** If you are working on a project with a team, [you can register as a team](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022031411-Participants-page-forming-a-team). Make sure to select `I'm looking for teammates` or `Yes, I have a team` when you register.
3. **Get an account with a cloud provider.** Check out our [docs page]({% link _docs/cloud_account_setup.md %}) to get started.
4. **Make sure you read the submission requirements for this hackathon.** They are listed on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zj7t2va) as well as on this page under [Project Requirements](#reqs).

## DevPost Submissions

UWB Hacks the Cloud will use [DevPost](https://uwbhacks.devpost.com/) to 
track project submission and evaluation.

To be considered for an award, **all projects must be uploaded to [DevPost](https://uwbhacks.devpost.com/) by Sunday, April 19, 2020 at 2PM PST.**

### Using the DevPost Platform

Create an engaging project page for your project. You can create the project from your account page or create a new project when you click `Manage your submission`.

DevPost has some advice on how to [create a project page](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021972051-Adding-projects-to-your-portfolio) and [submit your project to the hackathon event on DevPost](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021748772-How-to-enter-a-submission). The organizers also have a [set of best practices to follow](#best-practices), which is also available on the DevPost site for the hackathon.

After you've submitted your project, you can [edit your submission](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021749752-How-to-edit-a-submission) up until the submission deadline (Sunday April 19th 2020 at 2PM PST).

If you have any questions, [message an event organizer on Discord](https://discord.gg/EDBbxmt).

## Best Practices for Project Submissions

Industry mentors, UWB faculty, and hackathon organizers will be serving as judges for all submitted projects.

The more information the judges have to evaluate your project, the more likely you are to receive recognition for your hard work!

### Category 1: README

All submitted projects should have an accompanying document which explains the following:

- Goals of the project
- Desired user experience
- Implementation details and how cloud computing technologies were used to implement the project
- Issues encountered, bugs fixed or still present, and future work to be done (every project has them!)

### Category 2: User Experience Example

Show us how users interact with your project! It could be one or more of the following:

- Link to live endpoint (web app, custom API, etc)
- Video recording or screen recording of user interacting with the project
- Screenshots of the UI or other pertinent information

### Category 3: Implementation Details

We want to see how the project was created. Any or all of the following could be provided:

- Credentials for a read-only access point for the cloud platform used for implementation, so that judges can explore your configuration (if desired).
- Screenshots of configuration steps in the cloud platform used.
- GitHub repository containing all written code (Lambda/Functions or other programming language-centric products).

## Prize Categories

There are **three** prize categories this year.

Each of these categories will come with a prize pack, which will include a mix of IoT devices, DigitalOcean credits, merchandise, and a custom trophy.

### Most Innovative

The project which combines cloud services in innovative and technically advanced ways. Awarded by judges and organizers.

### Most Impactful

The project which facilitates community awareness, social inclusion, or otherwise improves the lives of your peers. Awarded by judges and organizers.
