## **Communication**
You can chat with other participants in the Hackathon through our [Discord channel](LINK_N/A)

For communication in between your team, you can look into the following:
- [Discord](Discordapp.com) = Easy to setup, lightweight, can share media easily
- [Slack](Slack.com) = Requires more effort to setup, can share media easily
- [Trello](Trello.com) = Create a board to keep track of things that need to get done

## **Collaborative Coding**
To keep track of your code and prevent issues utilize the following:
-[Git](git-scm.com) = Track changes and sync your code with others
-[GitHub](Github.com) = Keep all your coding files in sync and help track changes in a Public or Private repo.
*Note:* Github has something called "Projects" which is very much like Trello boards. So you can take advantage of these features!
-[BitBucket.com](BitBucket.com) = Much like GitHub, but with private repositories.

## **Collaborative Cloud**
Check out [our guide on choosing a cloud provider](https://docs.uwbhacks.com/cloud_setup.html) to pick a cloud platform to use for your project.

When you're ready, you can add users and give them permissions to use account services for your project. You can choose to share your administrator credentials, or you can create user accounts and give them specific permissions. When creating user accounts, you can follow the instructions for [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/marketplace-management-portal-user-access.html), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/access-control#developers), and [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory).
