## **Communication**
You can chat with other participants in the Hackathon through our [Discord channel](LINK_N/A)

For communication in between your team, you can look into the following:
- [Discord](Discordapp.com) = Easy to setup, lightweight, can share media easily
- [Slack](Slack.com) = Requires more effort to setup, can share media easily
- [Trello](Trello.com) = Create a board to keep track of things that need to get done

## **Collaborative Coding**
To keep track of your code and prevent issues utilize the following:
-[Git](git-scm.com) = Track changes and sync your code with others
-[GitHub](Github.com) = Keep all your coding files in sync and help track changes in a Public or Private repo.
*Note:* Github has something called "Projects" which is very much like Trello boards. So you can take advantage of these features!
-[BitBucket.com](BitBucket.com) = Much like GitHub, but with private repositories.

## **Collaborative Cloud**
**TODO** Insert information about how to share AWS accounts and give permissions to others.
