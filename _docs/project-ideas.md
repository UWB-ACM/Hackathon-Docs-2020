A fun project can make your hackathon experience that much better! Here are a few ideas for inspiration:

- A simple online game _(Check out [agar.io](https://agar.io/index.html), for example)_
- A website exclusively inspired by a randomly generated GitHub repository name _(How about `supreme-potato`, `bug-free-guide`, or `ideal-octo-meme`? What does GitHub suggest when you create a new repository?)_
- A wiki for memes
- SaaSquatch _(But what is that, you ask? We have no clue! What do you think it should be?)_
- Automated image modulation _(Check out [this website](https://deepfriedmemes.com/) for an implementation example)_
