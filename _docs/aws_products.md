With the Free Tier, you get 750 hours of run-time in which you can work on your applications. Note that if you exceed those free hours, you will be charged for additional hours. Refer to the [resources page]({% link _docs/aws_resources.md %}) for how to not get unnecessary charges from using this service.

Create an EC2 instance to remotely run commands using the AWS systems manager.

Data is stored as objects within resources called “buckets”, and a single object can be up to 5 terabytes in size. S3 features include capabilities to append metadata tags to objects, move and store data across the S3 Storage Classes, configure and enforce data access controls, secure data against unauthorized users, run big data analytics, and monitor data at the object and bucket levels. Objects can be accessed through S3 Access Points or directly through the bucket hostname.
