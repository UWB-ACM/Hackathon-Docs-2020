## [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc2=h_ql_prod_fs_ec2)
Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, allowing you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment, manage your network’s access permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as you desire.

Create an EC2 instance to remotely run commands using the AWS systems manager.


## [Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_ql_prod_fs_s3)
Amazon S3 has various features you can use to organize and manage your data in ways that support specific use cases, enable cost efficiencies, enforce security, and meet compliance requirements. Data is stored as objects within resources called “buckets”, and a single object can be up to 5 terabytes in size. S3 features include capabilities to append metadata tags to objects, move and store data across the S3 Storage Classes, configure and enforce data access controls, secure data against unauthorized users, run big data analytics, and monitor data at the object and bucket levels. Objects can be accessed through S3 Access Points or directly through the bucket hostname.

S3 can be used to store and retrieve a file or host a static website.


## [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?nc2=h_ql_prod_fs_aa)
Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of traditional enterprise databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases.

## [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?nc2=h_ql_prod_fs_ddb)
Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that supports key-value and document data models, and enables developers to build modern, serverless applications that can start small and scale globally to support petabytes of data and tens of millions of read and write requests per second. DynamoDB is designed to run high-performance, internet-scale applications that would overburden traditional relational databases.

Use DynamoDB to create and Query and NoSQL table.

Amazon RDS handles routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair.


## [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/?nc2=h_ql_prod_fs_rds)
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security. AWS Lambda can automatically run code in response to multiple events, such as HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, modifications to objects in Amazon S3 buckets, table updates in Amazon DynamoDB, and state transitions in AWS Step Functions.

Use lambda to run a servreless function.
