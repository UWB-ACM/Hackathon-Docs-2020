The UWB Hacks is a 13-hour event, which can be a little daunting. Not sure how to prepare? Don't worry, this list has you covered.

# 1-2 Weeks Before

- Make a team
    - 6 should be the max, but any group size below that is fine.
- Brainstorm ideas
    - Not sure where to start? Check out our [project ideas page](project_ideas.html) to get your creative juices flowing.
- Get reacquainted with your IDE, and what programming language your team plans on using.
    - If it's been a while, try out a "Hello World", just to ensure your development environment works.
- Sign up for an account with a cloud provider
    - Check out our [provider overview](cloud_setup.html) for more information about free tier access and account credits
