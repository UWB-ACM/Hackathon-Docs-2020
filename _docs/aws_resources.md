## Avoid Charges In The Free Tier

After you have signed up for an AWS account and begin using services, keep in mind a few things to avoid unnecessary charges from using services that are not covered within Free Tier:

1. Make sure services that you are using are covered by Free Tier. The list of those services can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc).

2. [Set up Free Tier usage alerts](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/preferences). Remember to keep an eye on your email to see if there is any usage alert from AWS.

3. Monitor your costs and usage in [Billing and Cost Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing).

4. Set up a cost budget. [Click here for more information](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/control-your-costs-free-tier-budgets/).

5. Clean up test resources when you're done using them. See the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) for information about how to clean up resources after you're done using.
