Whether you're a hackathon newbie or a 10x "Unicorn",
you might want to refer to this list while preparing
to attend the hackathon.

## Several Days Beforehand

Several days before the event is a great time
to start getting ready. Don't worry, you won't have
to do much!

- Start brainstorming ideas!
  - Ideas can be the _hardest part_ of a hackathon,
  so start thinking of project ideas early.
  Try to focus on projects that you believe
  are reasonably feasible in the time that you have.
  Hackathons are all about learning new things,
  but having a basis to start from can help a lot.
- Test out the languages, software, and services that
  you think you might use.
  - Some programming languages and tools require
  installation of large packages beforehand. During a
  time crunch, installing software is the last thing
  you want to be doing.
    - If it's been a while, try out a "Hello World",
    just to ensure your development environment works.
  - Signing up for online services like GitHub, AWS,
  or whatever else you may use can eat up valuable
  hackathon time that could be better used elsewhere.
  - Register for the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) 
  if you haven't already; this will let you use free 
  account credits on Digital Ocean to host your website. 
  The Education Pack also has credits and free access codes 
  for tons of other products, and is a great set of 
  resources to have in your toolbox while you're a student.
- Update the software on your machine, and ensure that
  it still works. This is always a good idea, but by
  doing this a few days in advance you'll have time
  to fix your system should issues arise.

## The Day Before

The day before the hackathon, you may still want to
double check the items from the previous list.

- **Charge your devices**, including laptop(s), phones,
  and battery packs.
- (Optional) Set up a sweet mixtape/playlist to listen
  to during the event.
